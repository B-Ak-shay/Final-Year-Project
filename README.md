**Introduction**

        Color cast is a common aberration in digital images that affects image quality and visual perception. This project aims to correct color cast aberrations using both traditional and machine learning-based methods, providing insights into their effectiveness and practical applications.

**Methods**

        We have implemented and compared the following methods for color cast correction:
Gray World Algorithm
White Patch Retinex Algorithm
Machine Learning-Based Algorithm: Utilizing linear regression on RGB values for efficient color cast correction.

**Evaluation Metrics**

        The performance of each method is evaluated using the following quantitative metrics:
ACMO (Average Color Mean Offset)
BREN (Brenner's Focus Measure)
GRAS (Gradient-Based Sharpness)
LAPM (Laplacian Mean)
LAPV (Laplacian Variance)
LAPD (Laplacian Diagonal)
WAVV (Wavelet-Based Variance)
**Results**

        The machine learning-based algorithm shows superior performance across multiple color cast levels compared to traditional techniques. The results highlight the importance of robust color constancy algorithms in mitigating color cast distortions.
